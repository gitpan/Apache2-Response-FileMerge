# the difference between t/conf/extra.conf.in and
# t/conf/extra.last.conf.in is that the latter is
# executed after modperl_startup.pl, which is 
# where @INC gets set.  because PerlModule runs
# during config parse for mod_perl 1.0, @INC
# needs to be adjusted before we call PerlModule
# otherwise our lib/Apache/Handler.pm won't be found
#
# make sense?

# mod_perl 1.0 sample configuration
